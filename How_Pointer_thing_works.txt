LPCTSTR = Long Pointer to a Const TCHAR STRing  (Don't worry, a Long Pointer is the same as a pointer. There were two flavors of pointers under 16-bit windows.)

Here's the table:

LPSTR = char*
LPCSTR = const char*
LPWSTR = wchar_t*
LPCWSTR = const wchar_t*
LPTSTR = char* or wchar_t* depending on _UNICODE
LPCTSTR = const char* or const wchar_t* depending on _UNICODE

"myname@address.com" is a const char*.  Try the alternative L"myname@address.com" which is a const wchar_t*.

If this compiles, then get into the habit of using the _T macro which will prepend L for Unicode builds, keeping your code as portable as possile.  e.g. _T("myname@address.com")
